# Deelgemeenten

[![Open Data](https://assets.okfn.org/images/ok_buttons/od_80x15_blue.png)](http://opendefinition.org/)

## Introduction

This repository contains a dataset of `deelgemeenten` as used by [Flanders
Heritage Agency](https://www.onroerenderfgoed.be). In our (unofficial)
terminology, a `deelgemeente` (sub-municipality) is a part of a current day 
`gemeente` (municipality) that historically used to be somewhat independent.
Most of them were a `gemeente` before the mergers that took place during the
seventies, but some of them were gone even before that time. As such this list
reflects no special point in time and has no historical significance whatsoever.
It is just the list we use in our day to day operations. Most importantly, the 
[Inventaris Onroerend Erfgoed](https://inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be) uses 
this list for indexing erfgoedobjecten, aanduidingsobjecten, waarnemingen, 
gebeurtenissen and thema's. You are welcome to use it, but please do **NOT** consider 
this an official list of `deelgemeenten`. As far as we know such a list does not 
exist either.

## Formats

Three files are provided. Both provide the same data, but in different formats.
The first, `deelgemeenten.csv` provides the data in `csv`format. The second,
`deelgemeenten.json` provides it in a simple `json` format. The third file,
`deelgemeenten.geojson` provides it in `geojson` format. Although at the moment the
geojson files contains no geographic information, it is possible that this will
be added later on.
